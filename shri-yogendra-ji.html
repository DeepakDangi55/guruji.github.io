                    His Guruji Shri Madhavdas Ji, blessed and trained him to be a true yogi. A Siddha, who demonstrated that being a householder can also enable you to achieve mastery over your physical and mental senses.
                    
                    Yogendra Ji firmly believed that people must be educated about yoga before they start practicing it.
                    He believed that yoga was meant to be in service of the whole mankind, for that he simplified complex yoga techniques and made them available to all.
                    
                    His work could be easily adopted and practiced safely.
